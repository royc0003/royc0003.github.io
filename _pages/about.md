Hello! One interesting fact about me is I was biculturally raised. I was born in Singapore, but raised in Myanmar the first 10 years of my life. The dichotomy between the two cultures might have contributed to my strong desire to drive innovation and impact within marginalized communities. Currently, I am exploring opprotunites to innovate at the intersection of healthcare and technology.

On a lighter note, I enjoy hiking, gymming and running. Recently, I've taken interest in bouldering. I genuinely think that bouldering is a sport for SWEs to congregate.

Lastly, I'm a follower of Christ [1 Cor 2:9-10] :).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
